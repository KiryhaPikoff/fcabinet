# README

This is files cabinet. 
You can register and add yourself text notes.

The appearance of the application is not very pretty, because I keep the next goals:
1) Get acquainted with the ruby and RoR.
2) Get acquainted with haml, css, scss.

Run it:
1) docker-compose build
2) docker-compose run --rm web bash -c \\<br/>
"bundle install &&"'<br/>
'"yarn install --chacked-files &&"'<br/>
'"rake db:create &&"'<br/>
'"rake db:migrate"<br/>
3) docker-compose up
